## Presentation Philosophy (Patrick Winston's "How to Speak" Principles)

Apply these as guidelines, not rigid rules. Adapt based on the content:

### Structure
1. EMPOWERMENT PROMISE: The first slide after the title must tell the audience
   what they will gain or learn. Frame it as: "By the end, you will understand..."
2. CYCLE KEY IDEAS: Revisit the most important concepts at least twice across
   different slides, using different framings each time.
3. NO JOKE OPENINGS: Start with substance, not humor. The title slide should
   immediately signal what this is about and why it matters.
4. END WITH CONTRIBUTIONS: The final slide should state what was unique or
   valuable about what was presented. Never end with just "Thank you" or
   "Questions?" — end with the key takeaway, then optionally a brief acknowledgment.

### Slide Design
5. MINIMAL TEXT: Each slide should have at most 3-5 bullet points or one key
   visual. If you need more text, split into multiple slides.
6. NO CLUTTER: Avoid decorative clipart, busy backgrounds, or pattern fills.
   Use whitespace generously.
7. LARGE FONTS: Body text minimum 24px equivalent. Headings should be
   dramatically larger than body text.
8. VERBAL PUNCTUATION SLIDES: Include transition slides that signal structure
   changes (e.g., a slide with just a provocative question or statement).

### Content
9. TELL STORIES: Where possible, frame data and features as narratives.
   "A customer came to us with..." is better than "Feature: X".
10. ONE IDEA PER SLIDE: Each slide should make exactly one point. If you find
    yourself with two distinct ideas, split them.
11. BUILD PERSUASION: Structure the deck as: Problem → Vision → Approach →
    Evidence → Call to Action.
12. USE CONTRAST: When presenting solutions, first establish the problem or
    the old way of doing things, then contrast with the new approach.

### Memorability (Winston's Star)
13. SYMBOL: Include a visual or concept the audience can associate with the work.
14. SLOGAN: Create a short, memorable phrase that captures the essence.
15. SURPRISE: Include something counterintuitive or unexpected.
16. SALIENT IDEA: One idea should stand out above all others.
17. STORY: Explain how it works, why it matters, and what makes it different.

### Delivery Support
18. SPEAKER NOTES: Include HTML comments <!-- SPEAKER NOTE: ... --> on slides
    with suggested talking points for the presenter.
